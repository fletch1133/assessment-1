//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the end goal is to look at the information given and determine what are the best steps to take forward to start solving the problem"
const design = "This is the third step, in which the end goal is presenting the design and determining which would be the best to implement into the project"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the end goal is determine which is the best way to code the problem and actually code it to its fullest extent and solving the problem with the correct code"
const testing = "This is the fifth step, in which the end goal is to test the software that has been built for any errors that may be present within the code"
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which the end goal is to keep checking the code for any errors or issues that may arise throughout its life cycle and making sure to fix any bugs or errors present within the code"
