//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/* Create a variable called 'myName' with a value that is your name as a string. */

//CODE HERE 
let myName = "Anthony Fletcher"; 
// We must set the value of myName equal to our name hence it states Anthony Fletcher

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/* Create a variable called 'faveNum' with a value that is your favorite number. */

//CODE HERE
let faveNum = 24;   
// We must set the value of faveNum to equal our favorite number. In my case, it is 24.

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/* Create a variable called 'lovesCode' and assign it a boolean value. */

//CODE HERE
const loveCode = true
// We must asign the boolean value to equal our opinion of loveCode to equal true or false. Since I do love coding, I assigned the value to true.
//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
  Write an if-statement that checks if the faveNum variable is 
  equal to 13. If it is, console.log('lucky 13!'). 
  If it's not, console.log('not lucky 13').
*/

//CODE HERE
if (faveNum === 13)
  console.log('lucky 13!')
else
  console.log('not lucky 13') 
  // Using the if loop, we want the code to determine if our faveNum is 13. We must console a scenario for each of the possibilities which are either true or false. Our faveNum is not equal to 13 so the false statement is correct.   
//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
  Write a for loop that prints out your faveNum 5 times.
*/

//CODE HERE
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
  console.log(faveNum)
  // Using the for loop, the number needs to be equal or less than 5 since the maximum amount we want the loop to run is 5. We must then console log our faveNum which is 24 to run the loop five individual times
